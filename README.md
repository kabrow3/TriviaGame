# TriviaGame

This is the Trivia Game Project.

It was completed for the fifth hoemwork assignment for the Coding Boot Camp.

It is based on Javascript and JQuery.

The game features several multiple choice questions which appear one at a time.

After the user chooses an answer the game evaluates the correctness of the answer and then loads the next question.
